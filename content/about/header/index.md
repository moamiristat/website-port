  Hello! It's nice to meet you.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
:wave: I am a Kinesiology & Health Science alumni, who probably (definitely) spent more time self-studying Mathematics than reading coursework during my undergraduate program. Currently, I am enrolled in the Master of Applied Statistics at Pennsylvania State University.

:briefcase: I am a volunteer Statistician for a Haematology/Oncology Research Lab at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Canada. My research role includes the application of treatments for moderating the long-term outcomes of pediatric thrombosis. I have done freelance data analysis for small businesses. My choice of tool for cleaning, analyzing and modeling data is R.
