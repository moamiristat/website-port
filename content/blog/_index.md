title: Let's Apply Stats With R
author: Mo Amiri
description: |
  A blog where I apply statistical methods to clean, analyze, and model data in R. The goal is to keep 
  each blog post bite-sized such that we tackle a few concepts, rather than conduct a full analysis, each time a 
  new dataset is introduced. Therefore, you may notice that certain project workflows are spread out across 
  several posts depending on how deep we dive into the analysis.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
